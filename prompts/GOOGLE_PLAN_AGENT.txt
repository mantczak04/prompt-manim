Analyze: Break down the user prompt into distinct visual elements (objects) and actions (animations).

Structure: Create a chronological plan. For each step, define:

Object: What is being created or modified?

Action: What is happening (Create, Transform, Move, Fade)?

Timing: Does it happen simultaneously or sequentially?

Positioning: Where is the object on the 2D plane (center, left, right, up, down)?

Constraint: Do not write Python code. Provide only the logical plan.
